Do you want to learn how to model your data for a database? Are you interested in understanding how to design a database schema that is efficient and effective? If so, this course is for you!

In this course, you will explore the fundamentals of relational database modeling, including how to identify entities, define relationships, and create a suitable schema. You will also explore best practices for designing databases.

By the end of this course, you will have an understanding of how to model your data for a structured database and be able to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to design effective database schemas.

This course is designed for anyone who wants to learn how to model data for a relational database, especially all the research technology professionals. No prior experience with database design is required, but a basic understanding of programming concepts will be helpful.

We will provide a case study and a dataset for the course, which will be used throughout the sessions. Participants will learn how to analyze the dataset, identify key entities, and design a database schema that meets the requirements of the case study. You are welcome to bring your own dataset if you prefer, but it is not required. If you choose to bring your own dataset, please ensure it is in a flat structured format (i.e., CSV, or similar) that can be easily modelled in a database system and please send us a copy of your dataset at least two days before the course starts so we can prepare accordingly.

The course will run on three sessions, each lasting 2 hours in the following schedule:
- **Session 1**: Introduction to Database Modeling (Date: 29 July 2025 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am)
- **Session 2**: Implementation of Design (Date: 05 August 2025 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am)
- **Session 3**: Data Insertion and Retrieval (Date: 12 August 2025 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am)

Participants are expected to attend all three sessions to gain the full benefit of the course. Each session will include a mix of lectures, discussions, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning. Participants will work in small groups to apply the concepts learned in each session to practical examples.
