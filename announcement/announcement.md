Do you want to learn how to model your data for a database? Are you interested in understanding how to design a database schema that is efficient and effective? If so, this course is for you!

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of structured database modeling, including how to identify entities, define relationships, and create a normalized schema. You will also explore best practices for designing databases that are scalable and maintainable.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to model your data for a structured database and be able to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, this course will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to design effective database schemas.

This course is designed for anyone who wants to learn how to model data for a database, especially all the research technology professionals. No prior experience with database design is required, but a basic understanding of programming concepts will be helpful.

We will provide a dataset for the course, which will be used throughout the sessions. Participants will learn how to analyze the dataset, identify key entities, and design a database schema that meets the requirements of the data. You are welcome to bring your own dataset if you prefer, but it is not required. If you choose to bring your own dataset, please ensure it is in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON) that can be easily imported into a database system and please send us a copy of your dataset at least one week before the course starts so we can prepare accordingly.

The course will run on three sessions, each lasting 2 hours in the following schedule:
- **Session 1**: Introduction to Database Modeling (Date: 29 July 2025 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am)
- **Session 2**: Implementation of Design (Date: 05 August 2025 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am)
- **Session 3**: Data Insertion and etrieval (Date: 12 August 2025 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am)

Participants are expected to attend all three sessions to gain the full benefit of the course. Each session will include a mix of lectures, discussions, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning. Participants will work in small groups to apply the concepts learned in each session to practical examples.
